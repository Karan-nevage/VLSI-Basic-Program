This repository contains a collection of **basic VHDL programs** implementing fundamental digital electronic components. It is designed as a learning resource for students, beginners, and engineers exploring **VLSI design** and **HDL coding practices**. Each program demonstrates the structural and behavioral modeling of essential building blocks such as **logic gates, flip-flops, adders, subtractors, counters, and multiplexers**.

## ✨ Features
- **Comprehensive VHDL Examples**: Includes basic combinational and sequential circuits.  
- **Educational Resource**: Beginner-friendly implementations for learning digital design concepts.  
- **Reusable Modules**: Each design is modular and can be integrated into larger projects.  
- **Simulation Ready**: All files are written in synthesizable VHDL, suitable for simulation in tools like ModelSim, Vivado, or EDA Playground.  
- **Structured Repository**: Organized by functionality (adders, subtractors, counters, etc.).

## 🚀 Steps to Run Simulation
1. **Open Your HDL Simulator** (ModelSim, Vivado, or EDA Playground).  
2. **Create a New Project** and add the `.vhdl` file of interest.  
3. **Compile the Design** to check for syntax errors.  
4. **Write a Testbench** or use an existing one to simulate behavior.  
5. **Run Simulation** and observe waveforms for verification.  
6. **Modify Parameters** (like clock, reset, inputs) to test different scenarios.
